# Chainalytic Framework

## The Purpose

There is a huge amount of data deep
inside blockchains which could bring
potential valuable insights. +

*This framework focuses on* 

- _Rebuild *implicit* historical blockchain data from transactions ( transition functions )_
- _Realtime time-series data aggregation_

*It helps to easily extract, transform, aggregate
and generate new data using your own rule
in a modular style.*

*Note*: it is *not* the tool that simply extracts chain data and dumps to big-data dataset (e.g. BigQuery)

It targets developers who are interested in building application for

- Blockchain analytic and insights
- Monitoring tools
- Data science, machine learning and AI
- Algo trading

I am also a big fan of link:https://icon.foundation[ICON], thus it comes with one built-in data aggregator for ICON public mainnet.

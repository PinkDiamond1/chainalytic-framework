# Chainalytic Framework

## The Purpose

There is a huge amount of data deep
inside blockchains which could bring
potential valuable insights. +

*This framework helps to easily extract, aggregate
and generate new data using your own rule
in a modular style.*

It targets developers who are interested in building application for

- Blockchain analytic and insights
- Monitoring tools
- Data science, machine learning and AI
- Algo trading

I am also a big fan of link:https://icon.foundation[ICON], thus it comes with one built-in data aggregator for ICON public mainnet.
